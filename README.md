# stop-watch-on-Nexys-A7-FPGA-with-Verilog
It is a repository in which stop watch is made in verilog and synthesized on Nexys A7 FPGA. 7 Segment displays of this FGPA were used to display centi-seconds, seconds, minutes and hours as the start button is asserted. We can pause, resume/start, reset this FPGA with buttons as input to FPGA and eventually stop watch.
